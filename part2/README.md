# Part 2: Implementation of Business Logic and API Endpoints

In this phase of the HBnB Project, you'll start implementing the application based on the design created in the previous stage. The primary goal here is to develop the Presentation and Business Logic layers using Python and Flask. This includes defining the essential classes, methods, and endpoints that form the core operational framework of the application.

## Presentation Layer

This Layer defines the services and API endpoints using Flask and flask-restx. You’ll structure the endpoints logically, ensuring clear paths and parameters for each operation.
## Business Logic Layer

Building the core models and logic that drive the application’s functionality. This includes defining relationships, handling data validation, and managing interactions between different components.
